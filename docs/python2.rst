Python 2 statement
==================

While Segno is a Python 3-first package, Python 2.7 is still supported
after January 2020.

There are no plans to drop support for Python 2, Segno supports it
as long as technically possible.

Update 10/2023: Python 2.7 will no longer be actively supported in the future 
because it is no longer possible to adequately test the version.

Please use Segno 1.5.x if you still need support for Python 2.7.
